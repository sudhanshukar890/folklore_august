	<h1>August-Taylor Swift</h1>
	<div class="main">
		<p>
			Salt air, and the rust on your door<br>
			I never needed anything more<br>
			Whispers of "Are you sure?"<br>
			"Never have I ever before"<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			But I can see us lost in the memory<br>
			August slipped away into a moment in time<br>
			'Cause it was never mine<br>
			And I can see us twisted in bedsheets<br>
			August sipped away like a bottle of wine<br>
			'Cause you were never mine<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Your back beneath the sun<br>
			Wishin' I could write my name on it<br>
			Will you call when you're back at school?<br>
			I remember thinkin' I had you<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			But I can see us lost in the memory<br>
			August slipped away into a moment in time<br>
			'Cause it was never mine<br>
			And I can see us twisted in bedsheets<br>
			August sipped away like a bottle of wine<br>
			'Cause you were never mine<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Back when we were still changin' for the better<br>
            Wanting was enough<br>
            For me, it was enough<br>
            To live for the hope of it all<br>
            Cancel plans just in case you'd call<br>
            And say, "Meet me behind the mall"<br>
            So much for summer love and saying "us"<br>
            'Cause you weren't mine to lose<br>
            You weren't mine to lose, no<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			But I can see us lost in the memory<br>
			August slipped away into a moment in time<br>
			'Cause it was never mine<br>
			And I can see us twisted in bedsheets<br>
			August sipped away like a bottle of wine<br>
			'Cause you were never mine<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			'Cause you were never mine<br>
			Never mine<br>
			But do you remember?<br>
			Remember when I pulled and said<br>
			"Get in the car"<br>
			And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?<br>
            Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the <br>hope of it all
            "Meet me behind the mall"<br>
            (Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car")<br>
            (And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?)<br>
            (Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)<br>
            ("Meet me behind the mall")<br>
            Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"<br>
            And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?<br>
            Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)<br>
            For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all<br>
            (For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)<br>
